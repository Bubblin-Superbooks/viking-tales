Then his father said:</p><p>"All the young of my herds, lambs and calves and colts, that have been born since this baby was born I this day give to him. I also give to him this thrall, Olaf. These are my tooth-gifts to my son."</p><p>The boy grew fast, for as soon as he could walk about he was out of doors most of the time. He ran in the woods and climbed the hills and waded in the creek. He was much with his tooth thrall, for the king had said to Olaf:</p><p>"Be ever at his call."</p><p>Now this Olaf was full of stories, and Harald liked to hear them.</p></div> </div>
