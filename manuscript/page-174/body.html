Then he launched his boat, and they sailed southward again. At last they found a place that Eric liked.</p><p>"Here I will build my house," he said.</p><p>So they did and lived there that summer and pastured their cattle and cut hay for the winter and fished and hunted.</p><p>The next spring Eric said:</p><p>"The land stretches far north. I am hungry to know what is there."</p><p>Then they all got into the boat again and sailed north.</p><p>"We can leave no one here," Eric had said. "We cannot tell what might come between us. Perhaps giants or dragons or strange men might come out of this inland ice and kill our people. We must stay together."</p></div> </div>
