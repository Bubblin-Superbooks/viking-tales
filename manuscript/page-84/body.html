They marched through the country north and south and east and west, burning houses and fighting battles as they went. People fled before them, some to their own kings, some inland to the deep woods and hid there. But some went to King Harald and said:</p><p>"We will be your men."</p><p>"Then take the oath, and I will be friends with you," he said.</p><p>The men took off their swords and laid them down and came one by one and knelt before the king. They put their heads between his knees and said:</p><p>"From this day, Harald Halfdanson, I am your man. I will serve you in war. For my land I will pay you taxes. I will be faithful to you as my king."</p><p>Then Harald said:</p><p>"I am your king, and I will be faithful to you."</p></div> </div>
