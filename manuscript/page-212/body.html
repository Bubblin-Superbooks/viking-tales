Thorfinn cried angrily.</p><p>The Norsemen's swords swung fast,  and many of the strangers died under them, but still others came on, throwing stones and swinging stone axes. The horrible yelling and the strange things that the savages did frightened the Norsemen.</p><p>"These are not men," some one cried.</p><p>Then those Norsemen who had never been afraid of anything turned and ran. But when they came to the top of a rough hill Thorfinn cried:</p><p>"What are we doing? Shall we die here in this empty land with no one to bury us? We are leaving our women."</p><p>Then one of the women ran out of the hut where they were hiding.</p><p>"Give me a sword!" she cried. "I can drive them back. Are Norsemen not better than these savages?"</p></div> </div>
