<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><p class="no-indent  ">sails.</p><p>When the starting horn blew, and their sails were let down, it was like the spreading of hundreds of curious flags. Some were striped black and yellow or blue and gold. Some were white with a black raven or a brown bear embroidered on them, or blue with a white sea-hawk,  or black with a gold sun. Some were edged with fur. As the wind filled the gaudy sails, and the ships moved off, the men waved their hands to the women on shore and sang:</p><p>"To the sea! To the sea!  
The wind in our sail,<br>The sea in our face,<br>And the smell of the fight.<br>After ship meets ship,<br>In the quarrel of swords<br>King Harald shall lie<br>In the caves under sea<br>And Norsemen shall laugh."</p></div> </div>
