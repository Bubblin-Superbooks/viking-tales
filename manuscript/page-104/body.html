They looked her over carefully and recalked every seam and freshly painted her and put into her their strongest oars and made her a new sail.</p><p>"This will be the longest voyage that she ever made," Ingolf said.</p><p>When the work was done, they put into her great stores, axes, hammers, fish-nets, cooking-kettles, kegs of ale, chests of hard bread, chests of smoked meat, brass kettles full of flour, skin bottles of water.
