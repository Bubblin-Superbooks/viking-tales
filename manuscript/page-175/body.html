So after a while they sailed back to their home and lived there.</p><p>One spring after they had been in that land for four years, Eric said:</p><p>"My eyes are hungry for the sight of men and green fields again. My stomach is sick of seal and whale and bear. My throat is dry for mead. This is a bare and cold and hungry land. I will visit my friends in Iceland."</p><p>"And our swords are rusty with long resting," said his men. "Perhaps we can find play for them in Iceland."</p><p>"Now I have a plan," Eric suddenly  said. "Would it not be pleasant to see other feast halls as we sail along the coast?"</p><p>"Oh! it would be a beautiful sight," his men said.</p><p>"Well," said Eric, "I am going to try to bring back some neighbors from Iceland. Now we must have a name for our land. How does Greenland sound?"</p></div> </div>
