The island was like a mountain of rock standing out of the water. The sides were steep and smooth. They sailed around it, but found no place to climb up.</p><p>"There are many other islands here," said Leif. "We will try another."</p><p>So he steered to another. It, too, was a steep rock, but one side sloped down to the water and was green with grass.</p><p>"Oh, I have not seen anything so good as that green grass since I looked into my mother's face," one man said.</p></div> </div>
