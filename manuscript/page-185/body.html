A little lake was there.</p><p>"What is growing on those hillsides?" Thorfinn said, shading his eyes with his hand.</p><p>He and some others ran up there. The people on shore heard them shout. Soon they came running back with their hands full of something.</p><p>"Grapes! Grapes!" they were shouting.</p><p>All those people sat down and ate the grapes and then went to the hillside and picked more.</p><p>"Now we are indeed in Wineland," they said. "It is as wonderful as Leif's stories. Surely we must stay here for a long time."</p><p>The very next day they went into the woods and began to cut out lumber. The huts that they built were little things. They had no windows, and in the doorways the men hung their cloaks instead of doors.</p></div> </div>
