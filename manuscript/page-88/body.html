In some places the cables had been cut, and the boats had drifted apart. Ships lay scattered about two by two, fighting. May boats sank, many men  died, some fled away in their ships, and at the end King Harald had won the battle. So he had King Arnvid's country and King Audbiorn's country.

All people were talking of his wonderful battles.</p><img class="overlay center" width = "14%" src = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/marvindanig/viking-tales/master/assets/images/017.png" /></div> </div>
