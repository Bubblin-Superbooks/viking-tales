<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><p class="no-indent  ">Ah, Leif! I did not think when we made those vows of foster-brotherhood that this would ever happen. But do not fear. I remember my promise. I had thought that a man's blood is precious in this empty land, but my vow is more precious."</p><p>Now they laid all those men together and tied on their hell-shoes.</p><p>"I need my sword for your sake, foster-brother. I cannot give you that. But you  shall have my spears and my drinking-horn," said Ingolf. "For surely Odin has chosen you for Valhalla, even though you did not sacrifice. You are too good a man to go to Niflheim. You would make times merry in Valhalla."</p><p>So Ingolf put his spears and his drinking-horn by Leif. Then the men raised a great mound over all the dead. After that they went aboard their boat and sailed for the islands that Ingolf had seen. It was evening when they reached them.</p></div> </div>
