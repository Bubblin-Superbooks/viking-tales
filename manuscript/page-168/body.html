A German, named Tyrker, was with Leif. He was a little man with a high forehead and a short nose. His eyes were big and rolling. He had lived with Eric for many years, and had taken care of Leif when he was a little boy. So Leif loved him.</p><p>Now one day they had been wandering about and all came back to camp at night except Tyrker. When Leif looked around on his comrades, he said:</p><p>"Where is Tyrker?"</p><p>No one knew. Then Leif was angry.</p><p>"Is a man of so little value in this empty land that you would lose one?" he said. "Why did you not keep together? Did you not see that he was gone? Why did you not set out to look for him? Who knows what terrible thing may have happened to him in these great forests?"</p></div> </div>
