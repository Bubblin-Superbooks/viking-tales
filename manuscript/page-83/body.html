All at once the king broke into a roar of laughter.</p><p>"By the hammer of Thor!" he cried, "that is a good message. I thank you, Gyda. Did you hear it, friends? King  of all Norway! Why, we are all stupids. Why did we not think of that?"</p><p>Then he raised his horn high.</p><p>"Now hear my vow. I say that I will not cut my hair or comb it until I am king of all Norway. That I will be or I will die."</p><p>Then he drank off the horn of mead, and while he drank it, all the men in the hall stood up and waved their swords and shouted and shouted. That old hall in all its two hundred years of feasts had not heard such a noise before.</p><p>"Ah, Harald!"
