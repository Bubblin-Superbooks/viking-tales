They drove down stakes all about a great field. They tied the hazel twigs to the stakes in a string. But they left an open space toward King Harald's army and one toward King Haki's. Then a man raised a white shield and galloped toward King Harald.</p><p>"We are ready!" he shouted.</p><p>At the same time King Haki raised a red shield. King Harald's men put their shields before their mouths and shouted into them. It made a great roaring war-cry.</p><p>"Up with the war shield!" shouted King Harald. "Horns blow!"</p><p>There was a blowing of horns on both sides. The two armies galloped down into the field and ran together. The fight had begun.</p></div> </div>
