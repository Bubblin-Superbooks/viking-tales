Great waves still rolled, and for days the sea  was rough, but they could put up the sail. Then one day Leif, as he sat in the pilot's seat, jumped to his feet and sang:</p><p>"To eyes grown tired with looking far,<br>All at once appeared an island,<br>A stretching-place for sea-legs,<br>A quiet bed for backs grown stiff<br>On rowing-bench on rolling sea.<br>A place to build a red fire<br>And thaw the blood that sea-winds froze."</p><p>But when they came near they saw no place to land. The island was like a mountain of rock standing out of the water. The sides were steep and smooth. They sailed around it, but found no place to climb up.</p></div> </div>
