My stomach is sick of seal and whale and bear. My throat is dry for mead. This is a bare and cold and hungry land. I will visit my friends in Iceland."</p><p>"And our swords are rusty with long resting," said his men. "Perhaps we can find play for them in Iceland."</p><p>"Now I have a plan," Eric suddenly  said. "Would it not be pleasant to see other feast halls as we sail along the coast?"</p><p>"Oh! it would be a beautiful sight," his men said.</p><p>"Well," said Eric, "I am going to try to bring back some neighbors from Iceland. Now we must have a name for our land. How does Greenland sound?"</p><p>His men laughed and said:</p><p>"It is a very white Greenland, but men will like the sound of it. It is better than Iceland."</p></div> </div>
