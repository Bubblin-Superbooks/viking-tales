And all that time he had not cut his hair or combed it. Now he was feasting one day at an earl's house. Many people were there.</p><p>"How is it, friends?" Harald said. "Have I kept my vow?"</p><p>His friends answered:</p><p>"You have kept your vow. There is no king but you in all Norway."</p><p>"Then I think I will cut my hair," the king laughed.</p></div> </div>
