"Let us find homes there."</p><p>Then Leif, in the high seat opposite Ingolf, stood up.</p><p>"No, not the Shetlands, my foster-brother. They are crowded already.  Besides, Harald will not long keep his hands off them. Then they will be no better than Norway. England and Ireland and Scotland are old. My eyes ache for something new. What of that far island that Floki found? It is empty. We could choose our land from the whole country. There is good fishing. There are green valleys. And Butter Thorolf says that butter drops from every weed. There are mountains and deserts where we may find adventure. I say, let us steer for Iceland!"</p><p>When he stopped, many of the men shouted:</p><p>"Yes! Iceland!"</p></div> </div>
