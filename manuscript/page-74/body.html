We will wait but an hour. I am eager for the frolic."</p><p>So Thorstein raised a white shield on his spear as a sign that he came on an errand of peace. He rode near King Haki, but he could not wait until he came close before he shouted out his message and then turned and rode back.</p><p>"Tell your boy king that we will not hang back," Haki called after Thorstein.</p><p>King Harald's men waited on the hillside and watched the other army across the valley. They saw King Haki point  and saw twenty men ride off as he pointed. They stopped in a patch of hazel and hewed with their axes.</p></div> </div>
